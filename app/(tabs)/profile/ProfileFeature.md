# Profile Tab Feature Implementation Plan (Engagement-Driven UI)

This comprehensive roadmap details how to implement the PocketrackrApp Profile screen to maximize user motivation, retention, and satisfaction. Every UI aspect should reinforce positive feedback, visualize progress, and make users want to interact and return.

---

## General Guidelines

- **All data**: Fetched/mutated via custom hooks (e.g. `useProfile`, `useUpdateProfile`) against the Supabase `profiles` table, authenticated with Clerk.
- **Component structure**: Shared UI in `@components/ui/`, profile-specific in `@components/profile/`.
- **File Structure**: All Profile Tab files live in `@app/(tabs)/profile/` or `@components/profile/`.
- **Styling**: Use the app `useTheme` throughout; all color and typography must align.
- **UX focus**: Every interaction should feel rewarding and fun, with instant feedback, subtle animation, and clear progress.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Motivating Header

- [ ] **1.1 ProfileHeader (`components/profile/ProfileHeader.tsx`)**
  - **Visual Layout**:
    - Clean header with "Settings" title centered
    - Optional settings gear icon (top-right) for quick access to advanced settings
    - Minimal, focused design that doesn't compete with content below
  
- [ ] **1.2 UserProfileCard (`components/profile/UserProfileCard.tsx`)**

    - **Avatar with Progress Ring**: Animated ring shows profile completion % (e.g. photo + name + email + preferences all set = 100%)
    - **Achievement Badge Overlay**: Small badge on avatar with current streak, or e.g. "Profile Star" for completion.
    - **Animated Background**: Subtle gradient or glow that shifts color as the user progresses or maintains streaks.
    - **Dynamic Greeting**: "Good morning, Surya! üåû", "Welcome back! üí™" etc., with emoji and time/context sensitivity.

  />
</SettingsCard>
```

### Data Model Integration

- **Habit Formation Support**: Streak tracking, gentle reminders, and celebration of consistency
- **Personalization Engine**: AI-driven suggestions that improve with usage
- **Gamification Elements**: Achievement systems, progress visualization, and milestone celebrations

### Key Engagement User Stories

- **"I feel accomplished"**: User sees immediate progress feedback for every profile action
- **"I'm part of something bigger"**: Community insights make user feel connected
- **"The app knows me"**: Personalized suggestions feel relevant and helpful
- **"I don't want to lose my progress"**: Streaks and achievements create positive pressure to return
- **"This is actually fun"**: Micro-interactions and animations make mundane tasks enjoyable
- **"I feel in control"**: Clear options and immediate feedback create sense of agency
- **"I'm getting better at this"**: Progressive enhancement helps user feel they're leveling up

### Development Conventions

- **Typed Props**: All row and section components are strictly typed.
- **Data Fetching**: All data-fetching/mutations go through TanStack Query hooks (`useQuery`, `useMutation`); do not call Supabase directly from components.
- **Global State**: Use Zustand only for ephemeral UI/control state.
- **Navigation**: Use Expo Router for modal/detail screens.
- **Accessibility**: Test with screen readers & device-sized text, non-color cues for all statuses.
- **Dismissal Logic**: Banners and suggestions respect user preference and are stored for UX persistency.
